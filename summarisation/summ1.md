How Globalisation Begets Inequality

# Main Ideas:

1. There was a large average income increase in China from 1980 to 2013 due to
   Globalisation.
2. However, the economic expansion has been accompanied by growing income
   equality.
3. Classical economics is an insufficient model to explain this discrepancy.
4. In response, Gates professor Michael Kremer and Adams University Professor
   Eric Maskin have proposed a new model incorporating a naunced understand of
   job allocation in global production cycles.
5. Their work originated as a study of developed countries but they soon
   realised that their model helped explain the effects of globalisation in
   developing countries.
6. According to Kremer and Maskin, globalisation has changed the work allocation
   strategies to favour only employing highly skilled but cheap labour from
   developing countries in developed countries resulting in less skilled workers
   being unable to participate in the paradigm shift.
7. A complication is that while few of these developing world jobs would be
   considered a 'high skill' job, they still remain out of reach for workers
   without a decent level of education due to the higher standards of export
   companes despite their capability to be trained.
8. They emphasise that they are not arguing against globalisation but instead,
   they argue for improving education policies in these developing countries
   where the lower rung do not have the means to receive education and where
   companies do not have the incentive to provide this education to their
   employees.
9. Thus, tweaks to the system are required in order to reduce the level of
   inequality in these countries.

# Topic Sentence:

Income inequality is a byproduct of globalisation in developing countries due to
poor education policies.

# Summarisation:

Classical economics is confounded by the increased inequalities experienced by
developing countries despite their average income figures increasing as a result
of globalisation. Professors Michael Kremer and Adam Maskin introduce a novel
model based on job allocation strategies to explain this discrepancy and propose
that education policy reforms in developing countries are key in reducing income
inequality. Globalisation has influenced export companies to favour skilled but
cost-effective labour with a relatively high requirement for education that
often lies out of reach for the lower rung. This is further complicated by the
fact that most of these jobs, typically considered 'low skilled', were performed
by workers without a high standard of education but were trained by companies
that lack the incentive in a globalised world.
