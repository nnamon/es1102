**A poisonous mix of inequality and sluggish wages threatens globalisation**

Globalisation is under attack by protectionist governments in response to
disgruntled voters who are disillusioned by the growing income disparity they
are experiencing. The author asserts that businesspeople and policymakers who
enjoy the prosperity brought about by globalisation should act to defend it
despite the impact on those who are affected adversely. They believe that the
economic benefits outweight the social drawbacks.

I disagree with their stance that a mobile society is better than an equal one.
Class conflict will exist as long as the large wealth gaps between the rich and
the poor exist. It is wrong that a person should live in poverty regardless of
their willingness or ability to work while the wealthy should live wasteful and
extravagant lives. The authors believe that this should be tolerated as it is
good for the economy as a whole.

According to Easterling (2003), 'capitalism is an economic system that is
inherently crisis-prone'. It is a system that necessitates conflict.
Particularly, conflict between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' which is further
exacerbated by the fact that the wealthy wield control over the resources the
poor require for survival trapping them in a cycle of wage slavery. Thus, I
argue that the societal mobility the authors support does not imply mobility for
all but only the select aristocratic elite and is hence destructive.

However, I do agree with the authors' suggestion that the implementation of
compassionate and egalitarian policies that cushion the impact of globalisation
on the working class is a step towards a progress even if the goals of the
author are motivated by the desire to protect globalisation. These progressive
policies such as re-training programs, the decoupling of pension schemes, and
the persistence of medical benefits after retrenchment will definitely help to
equalise society. Nevertheless, it is dubious that corporations would adopt such
a stance as the drain on their profits would be substantial.

The sentiment is not only shared by the authors of the article but also by
Claudia Juech, Associate Vice President of the Rockerfeller Foundation, a
philanthropic organisation working to 'improve the well-being of humanity around
the world'. In an article published in the World Economic Forum, she posits that
these shifts in the labour market is not entirely a crisis, but an opportunity
to revise the paradigm of employment in modern society (Juech, 2015). She
asserts that the detachment of benefits can provide safety nets for the
economically vulnerable and improve the efficiency of the workforce.

In conclusion, social and economic equality should not be compromised in favour
of societal mobility as large market movements that widen the gap between the
rich and the poor is inherently destructive. Instead, upper management of
corporations and policymakers should be acting with the the interests of society
as a whole by implementing progressive programs and policies to ensure that
globalisation improves the standard of living for everyone in all tiers of
society.
