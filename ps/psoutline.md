## Introduction

### Background Information/Context

Globalisation is the increasing interconnectedness between nations around the
Globe for the purposes of economic trade and cultural exchange. In conjunction
with the widespread advent of technology, globalisation has brought about both
beneficial and deterimental changes in the economic statuses of developing and
developed countries.

### Problem Focus of the Essay

The essay shall focus on the widening income gap between the working class and
the wealthy as a result of globalisation.

### Definitions and Concepts

1. *Proletariat* - The working class
2. *Bourgeois* - The social class that owns the means of production, or in this
   context, the largest shareholders and managers of large companies
3. *Globalisation* - The process of increased global economic and cultural trade

### Thesis

Globalisation is commonly acknowledged as a major driver of the modern economy
where global reshifting of labour pools as well as increased accessed to larger
markets have massively increased profits for companies. This change, however,
comes at a price: a widening income gap. In developed countries, the outsourcing
of labour to cheaper locations overseas has caused unemployment within the
working class. This paper will discuss the efficacy of protectionist and social
solutions proposed by economists and politicians.

### Topic Sentence

Globalisation has created wealth for developed countries, particularly America,
through the outsourcing of production lines and manufacturing. However, it has
also taken jobs away from the proletariat class in these countries creating a
wage gap between the working class and the wealthy.

### Problem Description

Outsourcing is a problem for the less skilled workers in developed countries
because foreign labour in developing countries is inherently cheaper. The
adoption of outsourcing is a logical step for companies who wish to maximise
their profits.

"GLUERS and sawyers from the furniture factories in Galax near the mountains of
Virginia lost their jobs last year when American retailers decided they could
find a better supplier in China." (The Economist, 2007)

### Concluding Sentence

The employment vacuum created by the export of labour requirements to foreign
developing countries has decreased employment opportunities for lower skilled
workers in developed countries while enriching corporate owners increase the gap
between the poor and the rich.

### Topic Sentence

Governments may implement protectionist policies to protect the interests of the
local economy against the profit-driven motivations of the globalised capitalist
free market.

### Explanations and Support

1. **Describe an existing solution:** Implement protectionist policies on the local
   economy to prevent the export of jobs to overseas markets.
2. **Evaluate its effectiveness:** In the American free market, competition and
   the innovation drives the economy. If policies were implemented to 'place
   Americans first', the market might stagnate due to the decreased competition
   which might in turn cause fewer jobs to be created.
3. **Evidence:** According to an analysis of Donald Trump's proposal for American
   protectionism by Moore and Kudlow (2015), 'immigrants fill niches in the
   labor market that natives can't or won't fill'. Thus, the jobs that
   outsourced or immigrant labour adds to the overall productivity and can
   contribute to the creation of new jobs with the creation of new businesses.
4. **Why the solution may be a problem:** As mentioned above, immigrant or
   outsourced labour may take away jobs from the lower rung of society but
   contribute to the creation of jobs for the middle class. The solution does
   not address the people who live below the poverty line through any mechanism.
   The wage gap still exists between the rich and the poor.
5. **Modifications:** It is my opinion that extreme protectionism and extreme
   laissez-faire free market capitalism are both bad. We should seek a middle
   ground such that free trade may still continue to exist but in such a way
   that the needs of everyone are met before profit comes into the picture.

### Concluding Sentence

Protectionism taken to its extreme can harm the economy but a measure of it is
necessary to protect vulnerable citizens who are unable to participate in the
process of globalisation from being left behind thus improving efforts to bridge
the income gap.

## Solution Two

### Topic Sentence

Globalisation is not inherently stable with the backlash it has been facing in
modern times resulting in governments adopting protectionist policies as a
response to an angry voter base. Companies should look towards defending
globalisation from hostile legislation by taking the initiative to implement
socially responsible internal policies that ensure society as a whole benefits.

### Explanations and Support

1. **Describe an existing solution:** Corporate social responsibility is a
   voluntary initiative undertaken by corporations and companies to reduce the
   negative impacts of their operations on society. This is relevant to reducing
   the impact of outsourcing causing unemployment in developed countries.
   Grassroots initiatives may help people at the top of managerial staff
   understand the issues faced by the working class and guide the creation of
   progressive policies.
2. **Evaluate its effectiveness:** Proper inclusion of corporate social
   responsibility when planning operations in a company can be effective in
   alleviating burdens. For example, re-training programs can improve the
   hireability of employees who are laid off in favour of moving manufacturing
   operations overseas.
3. **Evidence:** Sutter (2013) cites Michael Norton, an associate professor at
   Harvard as evidence that the breaking down of social barriers between the
   rich and poor (aka a grassroots initiative) can help create conversations
   across the income division and spark the development of policies that are
   beneficial to both the proletariat and bourgeois classes.
4. **Why the solution may be a problem:** Most companies adopt corporate social
   responsibility as a means of brand control or a marketing strategy without
   actually having the poor at heart. This may run counterproductive to bridging
   the income gap. Regulation on the part of governments for corporations to
   adopt progressive internal policies might also be counterproductive to the
   goals of a profit making organisation.
5. **Modifications:** NIL

### Concluding Sentence

Corporations that participate in globalisation must be aware of their corporate
social responsibilities and implement progressive policies that help cushion the
impact of outsourcing on the working class in developed countries such as
America. This acts as a means of closing the income gap by preventing the
working class from descending into poverty as well as protect globalisation from
protectionist policies implemented by governments in reaction to angry voters.

## Conclusion

### Restate Problem

Globalisation has introduced the concept of outsourcing: the export of labour
requirements to developing foreign countries. This creates an unemployment
vacuum in developed countries for the working class who find themselves laid off
by companies who wish to maximise their profits. Ultimately, this widens the gap
between the wealthy and the poor.

### Restate Solution

The first solution to this problem involves governments implementing
protectionist policies that ensures the needs of the local population before
utilising foreign labour.

The second solution involves the corporations and companies making the
compassionate decision to implement progressive policies as part of their
corporate social responsibilities. This effect is twofold: the working class is
able to keep out of poverty and dissuades reactionary governments from
implementing heavier regulations on the free market.

### Call to Action

Globalisation is a modern marvel that has improved the lives of the middle class
in developed countries and has brought a higher standard of living to those in
the developing countries. However, it is also a great divisor. It has the
capacity to make a lot of money: money that ends up in the pockets of the top
1%. The introduction of policies both regulatory and voluntary can only go so
far. For an egalitarian society to bloom, wealth should be re-distributed
fairly and justly.
